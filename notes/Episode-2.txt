"^2.12.0" (Caret ^):
This specifies that the version should be 2.12.0 or higher, but only within the same major version. In other words, 
it will accept any updates that do not change the major version number. So it will accept versions like 2.12.1, 2.13.0, etc., but not 3.0.0.
The caret (^) is more permissive and allows for updates that include new features or non-breaking changes within the same major version.

"~2.12.0" (Tilde ~):
This specifies that the version should be 2.12.0 or higher, but only within the same minor version. 
It will accept any patch-level updates (the last digit) but will not accept updates that change the minor or major version. 
So it will accept versions like 2.12.1, 2.12.2, etc., but not 2.13.0 or 3.0.0.
The tilde (~) is more restrictive and is usually used when you want to allow only patches that fix bugs without introducing new features.

1. package.json:

* Purpose: This file is the main configuration file for your Node.js project. It contains metadata about the project, including the project's name, version, 
  description, and dependencies.

* Dependencies: In package.json, you specify the dependencies (and devDependencies) your project needs, often with version ranges 
  (e.g., "express": "^4.17.1"). This allows for flexibility in which exact versions can be installed.

* Scripts: It also contains scripts for automating tasks (e.g., "start": "node app.js").

* Human-Readable: It is designed to be edited manually and is the file you would typically check into version control to share with other developers.

2. package-lock.json:

* Purpose: This file is automatically generated when you run npm install. It records the exact versions of the dependencies (and their dependencies) 
  that were installed. This ensures that the same versions are installed across different environments.

* Exact Versions: While package.json might specify version ranges, package-lock.json locks these down to specific versions. For example, 
  if package.json has "express": "^4.17.1", the package-lock.json might list "express": "4.17.2" if that was the exact version installed.

* Reproducibility: It ensures reproducibility by allowing anyone who clones your project and runs npm install to get the exact same dependency tree. 
  This is crucial for avoiding "works on my machine" issues.

* Not Manually Edited: It is generally not edited manually; instead, it's automatically updated when dependencies are installed or updated.
  Version Control: It should also be checked into version control, alongside package.json, 
  to ensure that everyone working on the project uses the same dependency versions.

1. Dependencies (dependencies):

* Purpose: These are the core packages your project needs to run in a production environment. 
  They are necessary for the application to function correctly when it is deployed.

* Use Cases: Any package that your application needs while running in production should be listed under dependencies. 
  For example, a web framework like Express or a database driver like Mongoose would be included here.

* Installation: When you run npm install or npm ci (in a production environment), these packages are installed automatically.

  Examples:
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.11.15"
  }

2. Dev Dependencies (devDependencies):

* Purpose: These are the packages that are only needed during the development and testing phases of your project. 
  They are not required for the application to run in production.

* Use Cases: Tools for testing, linting, transpiling, or other build processes are typically listed under devDependencies. 
  For example, packages like Mocha (for testing), ESLint (for linting), or Babel (for transpiling) would be included here.

* Installation: By default, when you run npm install, both dependencies and devDependencies are installed. However, in production environments, 
  you can skip installing devDependencies by using the --production flag or by using NODE_ENV=production which only installs dependencies.

  Examples:
  "devDependencies": {
    "mocha": "^8.2.1",
    "eslint": "^7.18.0",
    "babel-cli": "^6.26.0"
  }

***************================================*********************

* npm is primarily used for managing and installing packages, whether locally or globally.

* npx is used to execute packages directly, either without installation or using locally installed packages.
