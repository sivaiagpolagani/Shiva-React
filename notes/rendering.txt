We usually think client side rendering adding server side rendring to the react like additional layer for optimization.

Client Side Rendering VS Server Side Rendering

Client Side Rendering:

Load Js -> Fetch Data -> Render Components -> Interactive

Server Side Rendering:

Fetch Data -> Render as HTML -> Load Js -> Hydrate 


Mean while api returns data, we use spinner and it's not good way as per UI experience. So, We use shimmer which will show fake UI.
